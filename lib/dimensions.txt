When designing mobile applications, it's important to account for the range of screen sizes within each category. Here are the typical ranges in dp (density-independent pixels) for small, medium, and large screens:

Small Screens
- Width: 320 dp to 360 dp
- Height: 480 dp to 640 dp

Medium Screens
- Width: 360 dp to 411 dp
- Height: 640 dp to 731 dp

Large Screens
- Width: 411 dp to 480 dp
- Height: 731 dp to 960 dp
